		<h3>Football</h3>
		<p>Football is my favourite hobby. It's a team sport, in which you can score only by placing the ball inside the goal of the opposite team. Teams content 11 players – field players and a goalkeeper. ... He's the only person that can touch the ball with his hands, but only in his penalty area.Personally I play football for both training and
			fun. Many contacts with the ball improve the
			technique, and moving on the pitch builds the
			condition. Additionaly scoring a goal or
			blocking a dangerous shot is a really nice
			feeling, what makes football a good game for
			minimizing the stress. It’s good to have an onfield idol, that you can watch to improve your
			skills. My idol is Kaka’, because I love the way
			he dribbles and passes.<br><br>While playing, you must remember that
			football is a team game. Individual actions
			may be satisfying, but there’s more pleasure
			from the game when you remember about the
			teamwork. Moreover playing as a team is
			much more effective, and when there’s
			chemistry between the teammates, you can
			beat stronger or even more skilled oponents.
			Football is based on teamwork and that’s the
			best part of it in my opinion.</p>
		<h3>Criket</h3>
		<p>My cricket passion started when I was a small kid and I started playing this game with my elder brother in the back side of my home.At that time also I was a good player in comparison to the children of my age. May be because I love to play cricket and I play it too seriously focusing on each and every ball.<br><br>Like many other people in India I was also aspired to play for my country. My days were never complete without cricket I used to play with my friends after my school hours were over. I use my left hand to hold the bat & bowl the ball which many people found strange but I was comfortable playing. Later with time I learnt to play cricket well and started participating in my school teams. I was appreciated by the match viewers as I used to be the highest score holder of the match. I was identified as the best bowler of the Lawrence School (my school) at the age of 14 which was a great achievement for me and my parents in the year 2000.</p>
